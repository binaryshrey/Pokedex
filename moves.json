A Pok\u00e9mon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.\n\nThe doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.\n\nlife orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.\n\nThe user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.\n\nThe doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pok\u00e9mon's stats and types for damage calculation.\n\nAll other effects work as normal.",
